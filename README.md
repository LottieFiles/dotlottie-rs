<h1 align="center">dotLottie Rust</h1>

This is the Rust implementation of the dotLottie player and its related tools. It utilizes uniffi-rs to generate FFI bindings for Kotlin, Swift, and WebAssembly (WASM). these bindings are then used in the native dotLottie players for [Android](https://github.com/LottieFiles/dotlottie-android), [iOS](https://github.com/LottieFiles/dotlottie-ios), and [Web](https://github.com/LottieFiles/dotlottie-web) bringing consistency of playback and dotLottie features across all platforms.

## What is dotLottie?

dotLottie is an open-source file format that aggregates one or more Lottie files and their associated resources into a single file. They are ZIP archives compressed with the Deflate compression method and carry the file extension of ".lottie".

[Learn more about dotLottie](https://dotlottie.io/).

## Features

dotLottie-rs builds on the Lottie format, adding powerful quality of life improvements and new features:

- Theming support
- Multi-animation support
- Built-in interactivity powered by state machines (in development)
- Reduced animation file sizes
- Feature parity across platforms
- Guarenteed visual consistancy across platforms (Thanks to the [Thorvg renderer](https://github.com/thorvg/thorvg))

## Available Players

dotLottie-rs serves as a core player from which our framework players use:

- [dotlottie-web] (https://github.com/LottieFiles/dotlottie-web)
- [dotlottie-android] (https://github.com/LottieFiles/dotlottie-android)
- [dotlottie-ios] (https://github.com/LottieFiles/dotlottie-ios)

## Crates

- [dotlottie-rs](./dotlottie-rs): The core library for dotLottie native players
- [dotlottie-ffi](./dotlottie-ffi): The FFI bindings for dotLottie core player to kotlin, swift and wasm
- [demo-player](./demo-player): A demo player for dotLottie written in Rust

## Development

### Build Instructions

To build for all target platforms, it would be best to use a Mac. You will also need GNU `make`
installed, at a bare minimum. To ensure that your local machine has all the other necessary
tools installed to build the project, run the following from the root of the repo:

```bash
make mac-setup
```

### Performing builds

Builds can be performed for the following groups of targets:

- `android`
- `apple`
- `WASM`
- `native`

For `android` and `apple`, builds will be performed for all supported architectures, whereas
for `WASM`, only a single target will be built. These names refer to Makefile targets that can be
used to build them. For example, to build all `android` targets, execute the following:

```bash
make android
```

To build all targets, execute the following:

```bash
make all
```

### Native C-API

The C bindings can be generated by using the following command, which will place the include and library
files in `release/native`:

```bash
make native
```

On Windows, you should use the `Makefile.win` make file:

```bash
make -f Makefile.win native
```

Examples for using the native interface can be found in the `examples` directory, which also contains a
[README](./examples/README.md) with information on getting started.

### Other useful targets

- `demo-player`: Build the demo player
- `clean`: Cleanup rust build artifacts
- `distclean`: Cleanup ALL build artifacts

More information can be found by using the `help` target:

```bash
make help
```

### Release Process

Manually execute the `Create Release PR` Github Action workflow to create a release PR. This will
include all changes since the last release. This repo uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)
to determine the new release version. The [knope](https://github.com/knope-dev/knope) tool can be installed locally
and used to simply the creation of changeset files.

The release PR should be checked for correctness and then merged. Once that is done, the `Release`
Github Actions workflow will be started automatically to do the work of actually creating the new
release and building & uploading the related release artifacts.
